# Introduction & Scope

### Introduction

Generative AI has great potential for accelerating scientific discovery and improving research productivity. Positive applications include improved inclusivity through translation of texts for non-native speakers, efficient literature synthesis across large bodies of work, and assistance with writing analysis code. However, GenAI also entails significant risks including data privacy concerns and the inputting of confidential data into external systems, lack of reliability and reproducibility of research outputs, potential reproduction of existing biases, and significant threats to intellectual property and research integrity.

Without clear guidance on how to navigate the various ethical considerations and limitations of these systems and tools, researchers and supervisors report discomfort with encouraging postgraduate research students to innovate with these tools. Without guidance, researchers may potentially use them in ways that put research integrity at risk.

&#x20;**Cognitive Offloading Risk:** Recent studies have found a significant negative correlation between frequent AI tool usage and critical thinking abilities. Researchers must engage critically with AI technologies and avoid over-reliance.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Purpose

This guidance supports the ethical, responsible, critical and transparent use of GenAI systems and tools by researchers and supervisors. It provides:

* Core principles aligned with EU and national research integrity frameworks
* Clear guidance on data protection and GDPR compliance
* Practical case studies addressing common scenarios
* A decision framework for determining appropriate AI usage levels
* Specific guidance for supervisors working with research students

This guidance is not prescriptive and does not recommend what specific GenAI systems or tools should or should not be used. Instead, it takes a principles-based approach, building on the core research integrity principles of **reliability, honesty, respect and accountability**.

### Scope

This guidance applies to all individuals and groups who engage in, or support, research activities. This includes:

* All permanent, part-time or contract staff engaged in research
* Those involved in setting research priorities, strategies, policies and assessment
* All enrolled students who engage in research
* Research conducted on any campus or on behalf of the institution at any location
