# About This Resource

## Generative AI in Research

#### Guidance for Researchers and Supervisors

_Integrating Institutional Policy with a Practical Decision Framework_

**Version 1.0 — February 2026 | Living Document — Updated Regularly**

{% hint style="info" %}
**Living Guidelines:** This guidance is regularly updated to reflect the rapidly evolving GenAI landscape. If you have suggestions for additions or corrections, use the feedback button or contact the Research Integrity and Compliance Officer.
{% endhint %}

### About This Resource

This knowledge base supports the **ethical, responsible, critical, and transparent** use of Generative AI (GenAI) systems and tools by SETU researchers and supervisors. It was developed by SETU's **Working Group on Gen AI in Research**, a subgroup of SETU's AI Steering Committee established in late 2024.

This guidance is **not prescriptive**. It does not recommend which specific GenAI tools should or should not be used. Instead, it takes a **principles-based approach**, building on the core research integrity values of reliability, honesty, respect, and accountability — framed around the [EU Living Guidelines on the Responsible Use of Generative AI in Research](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/).
